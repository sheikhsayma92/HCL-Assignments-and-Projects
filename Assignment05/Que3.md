#### **PROJECT REPORT**

**===========================**



##### **Online E‑Commerce Website using Agile Methodology**

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**



###### **1. Abstract**

An Online E‑Commerce Website is a digital platform that enables customers to browse products, place orders, and make secure payments. This project develops such a system using Agile methodology, which emphasizes iterative development, stakeholder collaboration, and adaptability. The platform integrates product catalog management, shopping cart, payment gateway, and order tracking. Agile ensures faster delivery of features, continuous improvement, and scalability to meet evolving business and customer needs.



###### **2. Introduction**

E‑Commerce has revolutionized the way businesses sell and customers shop. Traditional retail systems are limited in reach and efficiency, while online platforms provide convenience, accessibility, and global market expansion.
