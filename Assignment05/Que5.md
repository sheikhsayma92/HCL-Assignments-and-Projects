#### **PROJECT REPORT**

**===========================**



##### **Healthcare System using Agile Methodology**

**--------------------------------------------------------------------**



###### **1. Abstract**

The Healthcare System is a digital platform designed to manage patient records, appointments, billing, and medical support services. This project develops the system using Agile methodology, which emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability. The platform integrates patient data management, doctor scheduling, and secure communication into a flexible and scalable solution. Agile ensures faster delivery of features, improved quality, and responsiveness to evolving healthcare needs.



###### **2. Introduction**

Healthcare services are increasingly shifting to digital platforms to provide convenience, accessibility, and efficiency. Traditional healthcare systems often lack flexibility and fail to adapt to dynamic patient demands. Agile methodology provides a framework for building responsive and patient‑centric healthcare solutions. By dividing development into sprints, Agile ensures timely delivery of modules such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and billing, while incorporating user feedback at every stage.



* ###### 2.1 Problem Statement

Manual or rigid healthcare systems are inefficient, error‑prone, and unable to handle large volumes of patient data securely. Patients face difficulties in booking appointments, accessing medical records, and receiving timely support. A dynamic, automated, and secure healthcare system is required to overcome these challenges.



* ###### 2.2 Need of the Project

\- To provide a centralized platform for healthcare services

\- To automate patient registration and appointment scheduling

\- To ensure secure medical record management

\- To improve patient satisfaction through real‑time services

\- To build a scalable system adaptable to future healthcare needs



* ###### 2.3 Project Scheduling (Agile)

The project is divided into four sprints:



| Sprint   | Activity                                  |

| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| Sprint 1 | Requirement analysis and planning         |

| Sprint 2 | Patient registration \& appointment module |

| Sprint 3 | Billing \& medical record module           |

| Sprint 4 | Testing, deployment \& feedback            |



Each sprint lasts two weeks and delivers a working module.



###### **3. Objectives**

\- To design and implement an automated healthcare system

\- To manage patient records, appointments, and billing efficiently

\- To apply Agile methodology for iterative development

\- Database – Stores patient, appointment, and billing data

\- Security Module – Ensures secure transactions and data protection



###### **6. Implementation**

The system is developed in iterative sprints:

\- Sprint 1: Requirement gathering and design

\- Sprint 2: Patient registration and appointment scheduling module

\- Sprint 3: Billing and medical record management module

\- Sprint 4: Testing, deployment, and feedback integration



###### **7. Output Screens**

The platform provides:

\- Login Screen

\- Patient Dashboard

\- Appointment Booking Page

\- Doctor Schedule Page

\- Billing \& Report Page



###### **8. Testing**

Testing is performed after each sprint to validate functionality.



| Test Case        | Expected Result       | Actual Result |

| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
