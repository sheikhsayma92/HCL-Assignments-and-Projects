#### **PROJECT REPORT**

===========================



##### **Automated Banking Website using Agile Methodology**

**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**



###### **1. Abstract**

The Automated Banking Website is a digital platform designed to provide customers with online banking services such as account management, fund transfers, loan applications, and transaction tracking. This project develops the system using Agile methodology, which emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability. The platform integrates customer accounts, secure transactions, and support services into a flexible and scalable solution. Agile ensures faster delivery of features, improved quality, and responsiveness to evolving customer needs.



###### **2. Introduction**

Banking services are increasingly shifting to digital platforms to provide convenience, accessibility, and efficiency. Traditional banking systems often lack flexibility and fail to adapt to dynamic customer demands. Agile methodology provides a framework for building responsive and customer‑centric banking solutions. By dividing development into sprints, Agile ensures timely delivery of modules such as account management, fund transfers, and loan processing, while incorporating user feedback at every stage.



* ###### 2.1 Problem Statement

Manual or rigid banking systems are inefficient, error‑prone, and unable to handle large volumes of transactions securely. Customers face difficulties in accessing services, managing accounts, and receiving timely support. A dynamic, automated, and secure banking website is required to overcome these challenges.



* ###### 2.2 Need of the Project

\- To provide a centralized platform for online banking

\- To automate account management and transaction processes

\- To ensure secure fund transfers and data protection

\- To improve customer satisfaction through real‑time services

\- To build a scalable system adaptable to future banking needs



* ###### 2.3 Project Scheduling (Agile)

The project is divided into four sprints:



| Sprint   | Activity                          |

| -------- | --------------------------------- |

| Sprint 1 | Requirement analysis and planning |

| Sprint 2 | Account management module         |

| Sprint 3 | Fund transfer \& loan module       |

| Sprint 4 | Testing, deployment \& feedback    |



Each sprint lasts two weeks and delivers a working module.



###### **3. Objectives**
