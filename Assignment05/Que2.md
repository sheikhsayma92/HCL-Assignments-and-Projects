#### **PROJECT REPORT**

**===========================**



##### **Travel Booking Platform using Agile Methodology**

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------**



###### **1. Abstract**

The Travel Booking Platform is a software system designed to simplify the process of booking flights, hotels, and holiday packages. It enables users to search, compare, and reserve travel services in real time. This project develops the platform using Agile methodology, which ensures iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to changing customer needs. The system integrates customer data, booking management, and payment services into a flexible and scalable solution.



###### **2. Introduction**

Travel booking has become a critical service in the digital era, with millions of users relying on online platforms for convenience. Traditional booking systems often lack flexibility and fail to adapt to dynamic travel demands. Agile methodology provides a framework for building a responsive and customer-centric platform. By dividing development into sprints, Agile ensures faster delivery of modules such as search, booking, and payment, while incorporating user feedback at every stage.



* ###### 2.1 Problem Statement

Manual or rigid booking systems are inefficient, error-prone, and unable to handle large volumes of data. Customers face difficulties in finding the best deals, managing reservations, and accessing support. A dynamic, automated, and user-friendly travel booking platform is required to solve these challenges.



* ###### 2.2 Need of the Project

\- To provide a centralized platform for travel bookings

\- To automate search, comparison, and reservation processes

\- To ensure secure payment transactions

\- To improve customer satisfaction through real-time updates

\- To build a scalable system adaptable to future travel trends



* ###### 2.3 Project Scheduling (Agile)

The project is divided into four sprints:



| Sprint   | Activity                          |

| -------- | --------------------------------- |

| Sprint 1 | Requirement analysis and planning |

| Sprint 2 | Search \& booking module           |

| Sprint 3 | Payment \& customer support module |

| Sprint 4 | Testing, deployment \& feedback    |



Each sprint lasts two weeks and delivers a working module.



###### **3. Objectives**

\- To design and implement a travel booking platform

\- To manage customer, booking, and payment data efficiently
